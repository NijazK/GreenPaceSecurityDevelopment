# Green Pace Secure Policy Development
* Software development at Green Pace requires consistent implementation of secure principles to all developed applications. Consistent approaches and methodologies must be maintained through all policies that are uniformly defined, implemented, governed, and maintained over time.

## Purpose
* This policy defines the core security principles; C/C++ coding standards; authorization, authentication, and auditing standards; and data encryption standards. This article explains the differences between policy, standards, principles, and practices (guidelines and procedure): Understanding the Hierarchy of Principles, Policies, Standards, Procedures, and Guidelines.

# Scope
* This document applies to all staff that create, deploy, or support custom software at Green Pace.

# First publication
* There are seven steps outlined below that align with the elements you will be graded on in the accompanying rubric. When you complete these steps, you will have finished the security policy.

# Second Publication/Improvements
## Revise the C/C++ Standards
* You completed one of these tables for each of your standards in the Module Three milestone. In Project One, add revisions to improve the explanation and examples as needed. Add rows to accommodate additional examples of compliant and noncompliant code. Coding standards begin on the security policy.
